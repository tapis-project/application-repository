The Pentagon is not currently tracking any injuries or damage from the four latest attacks.\n\n\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThe President has no higher priority than the safety of US personnel, and he directed today\xe2\x80\x99s action to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests,\xe2\x80\x9d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said of the US strikes on Sunday.\n\n\n  According to a US official, the four attacks\xc2\xa0were a mix of rocket and drone attacks across four different locations.\xc2\xa0On Sunday evening, a multi-rocket attacks was launched on troops at Mission Support site Euphrates, Syria, and two one-way drone attacks were launched on troops at Mission Support Site Green Village and al-Shaddadi, Syria. Both drones were shot down before reaching their target, the official said.

There were no casualties reported.\n\n\n  Other attacks this weekend included multiple one-way attack drones launched at forces at Rumalyn Landing Zone on Saturday morning; one drone was shot down before reaching its target, and another did not detonate upon impact.

And on October 26, the US\xc2\xa0struck two facilities\xc2\xa0linked to Iranian-backed militias.\n\n\n  On Sunday, a second defense official said that the training facility was believed to also be functioning as a logistics and weapons storage facility \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the secondary explosions observed following the strikes.\xe2\x80\x9d The safe house near Mayadin was assessed to be functioning as a headquarters facility for IRGC-affiliated groups in the area, the official said.\n\n\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThis operation was intended to disrupt and degrade the freedom of action and capabilities of IRGC and affiliated forces directly responsible for attacking US forces,\xe2\x80\x9d the official added.\n\n\n  The official also said that IRGC-related militia personnel were present at the facilities when they were hit, though they said they are \xe2\x80\x9cunable to provide a casualty assessment at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States does not seek conflict and has no desire to engage in further hostilities, but these Iran-backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop,\xe2\x80\x9d the official said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe specifically targeted IRGC-associated facilities to make clear to Iran that we will hold them responsible for these attacks against US forces.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSee Full Web Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Forces'
